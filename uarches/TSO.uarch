% To convert the SC uarch to the TSO uarch, you will need to do the following:
%
% 1. Add a store buffer stage to the microarchitecture.
% 2. Enforce that writes go through the store buffer before they reach memory.
% 3. Enforce that writes on the same core go through the store buffer in program order.
% 4. Ensure that a write is only released from the store buffer after all
%    prior writes from that core have reached memory.
% 5. Ensure that if a load is reading from memory, that core's store buffer has
%    no entries for the address of the load.
% 6. (Advanced) Allow a core to read the value of a write from its store buffer,
%    before that write is made visible to other cores.
% 7. (Extra) Implement a fence operation that flushes all prior writes to
%    memory before any succeeding instructions can perform.
